## Learnings

### Part 1

Felt like this was a very fun project. Trying to think through and break down the interactions was a lot of fun. 

Sometimes when code didn't seem like it was working, it was often because I had just forgot to pass through the arguments.

Thinking about function scope and what variables should be global and what should be local was also interesting.
